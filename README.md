# GeolocationWithSignals

Learn how to build a simple Geolocation app with PubNub Signals! For this app, a marker will initiially be placed in San Francisco. Drag and drop the marker anywhere you please, and the coordinates will be sent to a global channel using Signals. The marker will update for everyone connected to the channel! 

**Note: This app DOES NOT use your location!**

## PubNub Signals

PubNub Signals is a small message payload, no greater than **30 bytes**, that offers a **low-cost** data delivery rate while still leveraging PubNub’s secure and reliable [Data Stream Network](https://www.pubnub.com/products/global-data-stream-network/). Some use cases for Signals include:
  1) Typing indicators in a chat app
  2) GPS lat/long updates
  3) Sensor streaming updates for IoT devices
  4) Stats for gaming applications

## Setup

1) Sign up for a free PubNub account to get your Pub/Sub API keys.

2) Since we are using Google Maps in the app, you need to get a [Google Map API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key). Once you get the key, go to the **debug directory**, under **src**, and add it to the file **google_maps_api.xml**.

3) Clone the repo.
```bash
https://github.com/ocastroa/GeolocationWithSignals
```
4) Open the [MapsActivity.java](https://github.com/ocastroa/GeolocationWithSignals/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/geolocationwithsignals/MapsActivity.java) file in Android Studio and replace 'Your_Pub_Key_Here' and 'Your_Sub_Key_Here' with your Pub/Sub API keys.

5) Run the app on two emulators, drag and drop the marker to anywhere you please, and watch the location change in both emulators!
